# Domain Analyzer For Bug Bounty Hunting

Automation tool that allows you to check multiple domains and subdomains status: If the domain is up or not, and/or a response from the domain itself at all.

In order to properly run the code, you need to add the .txt file that has the list of domains that you want to analyze + the python script:
#### `python` `domain_analyzer.py` `yourlist.txt`
